# Ion-Web
The web part of Ion.

This is basically the part you really see, or atleast the adminstrators. The NodeJS app is located in the **node/** folder. This hooks into the plugin part of Ion and will handle the chat feature using Socket.io. Both the website and the NodeJS app will be located in this repository.
